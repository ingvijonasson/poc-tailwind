# Tailwind - proof of concept

1. Install

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run serve

    # Using Yarn
    yarn run serve
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

## Build and optimize for production

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production

# Using Yarn
yarn run production
```

After that's done, check out `./public/build/tailwind.css` to see the optimized output.
